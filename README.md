# XSL Transformer - XSLT
 This XSL Transformer (XSLT) let's you transform an XML file using an XSL (EXtensible Stylesheet Language) file. You can also chose your indentation level if the result is an XML file.

The XSL Transformer fully supports XML namespaces, but the declarations MUST be explicit and MUST be on the root XML element of both your XML file and your XSL file. See the XSLT Examples section for details.

*The maximum size limit for file upload is 2 megabytes. Results bigger than 1 megabyte will be written to a new window for performance reason and to prevent your browser from being unresponsive.
